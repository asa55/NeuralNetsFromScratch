# I did this for class and never really considered sharing it with the world.

The project instructions were as follows (literally no additional resources - this was very open-ended):
_____________________________________________________________________________
## Neural Network for Handwritten Character Recognition

 

We will implement an Artificial Neural Network, which is trained using the back propagation algorithm, to recognize the handwritten characters.

 

## Data can be downloaded from:

http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/CVSSP/demos/chars74k/EnglishHnd.tgz

Please use the image data.

 

1. In this project, the result of ANN is a matrix of 1*62. The output being obtained from the ANN can be used to obtain one of the 62 (26 Upper-Case, 26 Lower-Case, 10 numbers) characters of the English language.

2. The neural network implemented in this project is composed of 3 layers, one input, one hidden and one output. The input layer has neurons which use the images as inputs, the hidden layer has 100 neurons, and the output layer has 62 neurons.

3. For this project, the sigmoid function is used as a non-linear neuron activation function. Bias terms (equal to 1) with trainable weights were also included in the network structure.

4. Each class has 55 samples.  In each class, please randomly select 5 samples as testing data and the rest 50 samples as training data.

5. Hand in a simple report to summarize your implementations and results.

6. Send everything together via Blackboard.

7. Please note that the students should write all codes by yourself, not use any code from online.

## I have my final report which details the theory in depth - will link it here someday (especially if somebody asks for it)

This code uses handwritten digits pulled from a popular MNIST database. I didn't copy the data to GitHub (that's poor form),
but you can find the link in the instructions (or grab a copy of them from my Dropbox - more on that in the main ReadMe.md).

If you decide to check out this code, you'll need Matlab (I developed on 2018a so I can't be sure this is compatible with earlier versions)

I believe I stayed away from any tools outside of the core library - I haven't looked through this thoroughly since I wrote it but
I'll take it as a TODO item to post all the min requirements.

Assuming you have 2018a or later already, you'll need to grab this code, pull it into a folder on your Matlab path, then add
the MNIST database images to a subdirectory of the algo folder \EnglishHnd\English\Hnd\Img (some of the path comes with it when
you download the MNIST images).

Alternatively, I posted all the data-heavy materials on my Dropbox, so you can get everything you need from there. Check out the ReadMe outside of this $algos/$ folder - I think it will be much easier than pulling the resources yourself from across the internet, and it will let you follow the report (also available in my Dropbox) word for word.

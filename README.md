# NeuralNetsFromScratch

## There is more prescriptive info in the ReadMe.md in the algo/ folder

**Who this is for:** If you are interested in learning how to code your own neural networks from scratch using raw mathematics, this is for you. For anyone else, I implore you to skip this tutorial and go learn how to use Keras.

**If you decide to stick around:** Jump into the $algos/$ folder. There you will find all the Matlab code I used for my implementation. This was never intended to be an open source project, so my apologies for the lack of file structure. But it is easy to work with. The ReadMe.md folder there tells you more on how to get started with my software. Some of the descriptions in that ReadMe might not be perfectly clear. If you feel like you're having any trouble at all getting the code to work, then try the following:
(1) Get all of the code in my algos/ folder onto your development machine
(2) Add that folder to your Matlab path (from Matlab: right click, add all folders and subfolders to path)
(3) Follow the instructions in the algos/ folder **OR** download [these materials from my DropBox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/v1y7rq5hsd6g16l/AADKh8Z6A3aC_r3DebGhSGPka?dl=0) and put the contents in the *same folder as the content* of the algos/ folder. Specifically, the EnglishHnd folder should be at the same folder level as Main.m.
(4) Open the NeuralNetsFromScratch.docx file and follow the *Quickstart Guide to the Code* on Page 3.

That's it! If you have any questions/comments/concerns please land them in this GitHub repo or email me at asa55 at pitt dt edu.

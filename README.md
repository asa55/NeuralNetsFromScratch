# NeuralNetsFromScratch

## There is more prescriptive info in the ReadMe.md in the algo/ folder
I did a machine learning project where I implemented a NN from fundamental principles for character recognition using matlab. This is not a carbon copy of anyone elses work and you'd be surprised how sticky the implementation details got as I navigated the theory. It was well worth the effort, but if you're not a huge fan of seemingly tortuous math I would recommend you jump straight into Keras. I have the project report - when I decide to host it publicly (in dropbox or something) I'll link it via the readme.md here

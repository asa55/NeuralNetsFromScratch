# NeuralNetsFromScratch

## There is more detailed project info in the `ReadMe.md` in the `algo/` folder

**Who this is for:** If you are interested in learning how to code your own neural networks from scratch using raw mathematics, this is for you. For anyone else, I implore you to skip this tutorial and go learn how to use Keras.

**If you decide to stick around:** Jump into the `algo/` folder. There you will find all the Matlab code I used for my implementation.

### Quick Start:

1. Clone my code in the `algo/` folder
2. Add that folder to your Matlab path (from Matlab: right click, add all folders and subfolders to path)
3. Follow the instructions in the `algo/` folder **OR** download [these materials from my DropBox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/v1y7rq5hsd6g16l/AADKh8Z6A3aC_r3DebGhSGPka?dl=0) and put the contents in the *same folder as the content* of the `algo/` folder. Specifically, the `EnglishHnd/` folder should be at the same folder level as `Main.m`.
4. Open the `NeuralNetsFromScratch.docx` file and follow the *Quickstart Guide to the Code* on Page 3.

### That's all there is to it!
